    "# Classification of gHM in four types of terrestrial anthromes\n",
    "This notebook has the methodology used to create the raster layers from the [GHM data](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14549). This is a single raster with a continuous variable from 0 to 1 (Low to high level of encroachment). The resolution of this dataset is 1-km. [Supplementary figure 11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2Fgcb.14549&file=gcb14549-sup-0001-AppendixS1.pdf) from the gHM paper shows a summary (the median) of the GHm values accross 19 Anthromes). \n",
